A good **couple budget** is not about controlling each other. It is about clear rules, shared priorities, and fair effort.

## 1) pick your operating model

Three common models:
- shared account + personal accounts
- proportional split based on income
- fixed split by category

Pick the model you can maintain long term.

## 2) map shared expenses

List all shared costs in one place: housing, utilities, groceries, mobility, insurance, subscriptions. Then define who pays what and when.

The [monthly budget calculator](/en/calculateurs/budget-mensuel) helps build a shared financial snapshot.

## 3) set one shared savings goal

A shared project improves consistency: emergency buffer, travel, down payment. Use the [automatic savings calculator](/en/calculateurs/epargne-automatique) to define a realistic monthly contribution.

## 4) protect personal freedom

Keep a personal spending allowance with no justification required. This usually reduces tension and improves long-term cooperation.

## 5) run a monthly money check-in

In 20 minutes:
- review gaps vs budget
- adjust categories
- decide priorities for next month

## Conclusion

A couple budget works when rules are simple, visible, and reviewed regularly.
