Budgeting can feel overwhelming, but proven frameworks can make it easier. The 50/30/20 rule offers a practical way to split your net income into three categories: needs, wants, and savings.

## What is the 50/30/20 rule?

The rule suggests allocating your monthly net income as follows:
- 50% for essential needs
- 30% for wants and lifestyle expenses
- 20% for savings and debt repayment

This structure helps you cover essentials while still building financial resilience.

## How to apply the 50/30/20 rule

### 1. Calculate your monthly net income

Start from your take-home income (after taxes and mandatory deductions). Use our [monthly budget calculator](/en/calculateurs/budget-mensuel) to estimate your baseline.

### 2. Define your needs (50%)

Needs usually include:
- Housing (rent or mortgage)
- Food
- Transportation
- Utilities and insurance
- Core healthcare costs

If this category is above 50%, you may need to reduce fixed costs or increase income.

### 3. Track your wants (30%)

Wants may include:
- Dining out
- Entertainment
- Non-essential shopping
- Subscriptions

The objective is balance, not deprivation.

### 4. Plan your savings (20%)

Savings can include:
- Emergency fund
- Retirement contributions
- Short-term projects
- Debt repayment

Use our [automatic savings calculator](/en/calculateurs/epargne-automatique) to design a realistic contribution plan.

## Example

For a monthly net income of 2,000€:
- Needs (50%): 1,000€
- Wants (30%): 600€
- Savings (20%): 400€

## Benefits of the method

- Simple and easy to remember
- Balanced between current life and future goals
- Adaptable to different lifestyles

## Limits and adjustments

In high-cost areas, needs may exceed 50%. You can adapt to alternatives like 60/20/20 while preserving regular savings discipline.

## Common mistakes to avoid

- Underestimating essential costs
- Treating all spending as “needs”
- Ignoring periodic reviews
- Skipping savings in high-income months

## Conclusion

The 50/30/20 rule is a strong starting point for financial control. Pair it with practical tools and monthly tracking for better long-term outcomes.
