A clear **bill split** process saves time and avoids awkward conversations.

## Rule 1: validate the final total

Confirm service fees, taxes, and extras first. A wrong base creates wrong shares.

## Rule 2: choose split logic

Two common options:
- equal split
- weighted split based on consumption

Use the [split bill calculator](/en/daily-life/partage-addition) for a fast and transparent result.

## Rule 3: handle tip explicitly

Decide tip policy first, then apply the same split rule. For quick checks, use the [tip calculator](/en/daily-life/pourboire).

## Rule 4: define rounding

Rounding up can simplify cash settlements. Agree on the rounding rule before finalizing.

## Conclusion

Good group payment experiences come from clarity: correct total, explicit rule, visible calculation.
