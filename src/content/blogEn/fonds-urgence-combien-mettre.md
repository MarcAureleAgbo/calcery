An **emergency fund** protects your budget against shocks: repairs, health costs, or temporary income loss.

## How much should you target?

Simple ranges:
- 1 to 2 months of fixed costs for very stable income
- 3 to 4 months for a standard profile
- 6 months or more for variable income

## Build the right target

Count only essential costs:
- housing
- food
- transportation
- insurance
- healthcare
- non-negotiable family expenses

Use the [monthly budget calculator](/en/calculateurs/budget-mensuel) to isolate that core amount.

## Build steadily

Automate a dedicated monthly transfer. Even small amounts matter when consistent.

## Where to hold it

Keep the fund liquid and low risk. The objective is availability, not maximum return.

## Conclusion

Emergency savings are a financial shock absorber. Start now with a first milestone, then scale.
