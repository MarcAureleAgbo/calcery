**Automatic savings** is one of the most reliable levers for financial progress. It lowers mental friction and removes repeated decisions.

## Why automation works

A transfer at the beginning of the month creates positive constraints. You adapt spending to what remains.

## Build a progressive strategy

Start with an amount you can keep, then increase in steps.

Example:
- months 1 to 3: 80 EUR
- months 4 to 6: 110 EUR
- months 7 to 12: 140 EUR

Use the [automatic savings calculator](/en/finance/epargne-automatique) to test scenarios.

## Tie savings to a concrete goal

Specific goals improve consistency: emergency fund, travel, training, down payment.

## What to do in difficult months

Do not stop the system. Lower the transfer temporarily, but keep automation active.

## Common mistakes

- starting with an unrealistic amount
- never increasing contributions after income growth
- ignoring seasonal costs
- keeping savings in an account that is too easy to spend

## Conclusion

Start small, automate, and increase over time. Consistency is the key driver.
