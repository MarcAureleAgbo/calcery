**Tipping** is both cultural and financial. Expectations vary by country and context, so a simple framework is useful.

## In France

Service is often included, but a small extra remains common for good service.

## While traveling

In some countries tipping is expected; in others, less common. Adapting to local norms is usually the best approach.

## Quick calculation ranges

- standard service: 5%
- good service: 8% to 12%
- exceptional service: 15%+

Use the [tip calculator](/en/calculateurs/pourboire) for instant totals and per-person amounts.

## For groups

Agree on tip percentage first, then split the final amount with the [split bill calculator](/en/calculateurs/partage-addition).

## Conclusion

A good tip is consistent with service quality, local context, and your own budget boundaries.
