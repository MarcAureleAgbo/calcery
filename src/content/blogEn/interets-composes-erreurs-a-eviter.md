**Compound interest** is powerful, but outcomes depend heavily on behavior. A few common mistakes can significantly reduce long-term results.

## Mistake 1: starting too late

Time is your strongest ally. Starting earlier often matters more than investing larger amounts later.

## Mistake 2: interrupting contributions

Consistency matters as much as return. Small recurring amounts can produce strong cumulative effects.

## Mistake 3: unrealistic assumptions

Overly optimistic return assumptions can lead to poor planning. Test conservative, base, and optimistic cases with the [compound interest calculator](/en/calculateurs/interets-composes).

## Mistake 4: ignoring inflation

Nominal return is not real purchasing power. Evaluate results in real terms.

## Mistake 5: changing strategy too often

Constant changes reduce discipline. Set a framework and review it periodically.

## Conclusion

Long-term performance is mostly about process quality and consistency.
