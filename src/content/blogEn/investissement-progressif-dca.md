**DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging)** means investing a fixed amount on a fixed schedule. It reduces emotional timing decisions.

## Why DCA helps

You stop trying to predict the perfect entry point. Regular investing smooths entry prices over time.

## How to implement DCA

1. choose a monthly amount you can sustain
2. set one fixed transfer date
3. automate execution
4. review quarterly, not daily

Use the [compound interest calculator](/en/calculateurs/interets-composes) to project long-term effects.

## Strengths

- stronger discipline
- lower timing stress
- fits monthly budgeting
- easy to track

## Limits

- does not remove market risk
- may underperform lump-sum in a strong bull market
- requires consistency

## Conclusion

DCA is not perfect, but it is robust for people who value repeatable behavior and long-term progress.
