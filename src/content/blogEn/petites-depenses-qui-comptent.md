Large expenses attract attention, but recurring small purchases often have the biggest long-term impact on budgets. A daily coffee, convenience snacks, or forgotten subscriptions can quietly consume a large annual amount.

## Why small expenses matter

If you spend 5€ per day on impulse purchases:
- Per week: 35€
- Per month: ~150€
- Per year: ~1,825€
