A strong **monthly budget** is not just expense tracking. It helps you decide where your money goes before the month is over. The goal is simple: stay in control, reduce surprises, and create consistent savings.

## Step 1: set a clear structure

Split your cash flow into three blocks:
- income
- fixed costs (housing, subscriptions, insurance)
- variable costs (food, transport, lifestyle)

Use the [monthly budget calculator](/en/calculateurs/budget-mensuel) to build your baseline quickly.

## Step 2: set category limits

For each variable category, define a realistic spending cap. Consistency matters more than perfection.

Typical ranges:
- food: 12% to 20% of income
- mobility: 8% to 15%
- leisure: 5% to 12%

## Step 3: automate savings

Without automation, savings usually come last. Schedule a transfer at the beginning of each month, even if small. The [automatic savings calculator](/en/calculateurs/epargne-automatique) turns your target into a concrete monthly amount.

## Step 4: review weekly

A 10-minute weekly review is enough:
- compare actual vs plan
- adjust categories if needed
- prepare upcoming expenses

## Common mistakes

- ignoring annual expenses
- underestimating lifestyle spending
- no safety margin
- never updating after income changes

## Conclusion

A useful budget is a living budget. Test, adjust, and stabilize your method over two to three months.
