  { question: 'How is it different from simple interest?', answer: 'Simple interest grows only on principal, compound interest grows on principal plus interest.' },
  { question: 'Does compounding frequency matter?', answer: 'Yes. More frequent compounding usually increases final amount.' },
  { question: 'How long to double money?', answer: 'Rule of 72 is a rough shortcut: 72 divided by annual rate.' },
  { question: 'Is this forecast guaranteed?', answer: 'No. It is a projection based on assumptions you enter.' },

  'Increase contributions gradually over time.',
